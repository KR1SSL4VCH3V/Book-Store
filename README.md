Book Management: Users can add new books to their library, edit book details, and delete books they no longer want to keep.

Reading Status: Users can mark books as "read" or "to-read" to keep track of their reading progress.

Search Books: The app integrates with the Google Books API to allow users to search for books based on titles, authors, or ISBN numbers.

Usage:
